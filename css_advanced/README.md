## 🚀 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain what CSS is and how it works
- Apply styles directly and externally to HTML elements
- Use CSS selectors, classes, and IDs effectively
- Understand and compute **CSS specificity**
- Apply the **Box Model**: margin, border, padding, content
- Explain how a browser parses and renders HTML + CSS
- Reproduce layout fidelity from a Figma design

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup with accessibility in mind
- **CSS3** — Custom styling, Flexbox, pseudo-classes, and layout management
- **Figma** — Design replication and layout inspection (no plugins)

---

## 🖼️ Design Reference

The design is sourced from a Figma file provided in the project brief. All layout, spacing, colors, and images reflect that reference as closely as possible.

> ✅ Tip: If the fonts used in Figma aren't available locally, download and install:
> - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
> - Spin-Cycle-OT (external font link provided in project instructions)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

- External stylesheet linking and file structuring
- Class and ID selectors for modular styling
- Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Consistent color schemes and design tokens
- Section-by-section breakdown: Header, Banner, Quote, Videos, Membership, FAQ, Footer

---

## ✅ Project Constraints

- No external libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery)
- Pure **HTML + CSS** only
- W3C-compliant code (validated using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/))
- Exact match to Figma layout in dimensions and structure
